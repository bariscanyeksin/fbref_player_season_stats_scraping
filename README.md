# Scraping Season Stats for Players from FBREF

After my match data scraping project from FotMob I wanted to do another project related to data scraping. This scraping will be from FBREF, another well known website for detailed football statistics. 

In this project I used the Beautiful Soup library to do data scraping. It was not a simple data scraping as the table structure I was going to pull the data from is a bit strange. There are two layers of column headers in the table, so I had to organize them first. If you don't like this column header structure I created, you can edit it as you like from the relevant section of the script.
